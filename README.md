# Machine-Learning-mini-projects
Mini-projects on Regression, Classification and Clustering

In this repository we have three mini-projects on ML

1st Project: REGRESSION
Here,firstly I performed EDA then I built a Machine learning model and predicted the test data.

2nd Project: Classification
Here,I have performed EDA and then built a model for classification and evaluated the model.

3rd Project: Clustering
Here,I have perforemd EDA and then built the multiple clustering models and then evaluated it and concluded the best model.

Tools used in all projects : python, Pandas,Numpy,matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn
